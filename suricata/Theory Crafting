Theory crafting, this all sounded like a good rule today, but maybe not tomorrow; who knows.

# Rule looking for a response from a server with the contents of /etc/passwd from a server to a client. Probably best to put this rule on public facing devices

# Define protected/ not authorized subnets and monitor for access. Just theory crafting, could be good for internal traffic reviews
# Looks for flows larger then 18 bytes to / from a client or server then triggers an alert. In theory, this rule should work, I did follow the Suricata doc's :)
# Could also define some $PROTECTED_PORTS as a destination to prevent noise

# PoD = Ping of death. Looks for large icmp packets (fragmented) (5k bytes), could potentially just check for a max MTU size?
# Does only_frag work with stream_size? Who knows, the source doc isn't telling me
